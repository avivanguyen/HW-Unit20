        <h2> User Interview</h2>
        <p>
             For our interviews, we each interviewed four people (a total of 16 interviews) that are at least 20 years old or older, living with roommates or their significant other.
        </p>
        <p>
            The objectives of the interview were:
            <li>To understand the mindset of individuals around chores.</li>
            <li>To understand the user's struggles (if any) in scheduling their chores.</li>
            <li>To understand ho to help the user complete household chores.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            From our interviews, we organized the interviewee's answers and categorized them within an Affinity Diagram. Keeping in mind the insights that the interviewees provided helped us focus on features for our app, one of the main features mentioned would be a scheduling platform. Adults have many other obligations to do throughout their day and there are times that things slip from our minds. Coming home from a hard day's work drains the energy already. Hoping that our direction for the app can help users feel more at ease with cleaning chores.

        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <p>First Prototype Testing</p>
        <p>
            With my team, we started sketching ideas on Figma based on the user flow for a low-fidelity wireframe. However, after creating our prototype individually, and performing our first user testing, we noticed that we each had our own ideas for the layout of the "Home" page. It was interesting to see that we had similar designs for the "Task Dashboard" and the "Team Hub" but completely had different designs for the "Home".
        </p>
        <p>
            One takeaway was that not everyone would have the same thought process and you can design something in various ways even if you briefly discussed the elements of the design.
        </p>
        <p>
            User Testing Tasks:
            <li>Navigating the "Calendar" to view the weekly and monthly tasks.</li>
            <li>Add a task.</li>
            <li>Send a reminder to a member of the group.</li>
